                The ultimate goal of Ultima 6 Randomizer is to beat the game.
                To do this at a minimum you will need to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Collect the <b>8 Moonstones</b></li>
                    <li>Collect the <b>Vortex Cube</b> and insert the 8 Moonstones into it</li>
                    <li>Craft the <b>Gargoyle Lens</b> from the <b>Broken Lens</b></li>
                    <li>Craft the <b>Human Lens</b> from a <b>Glass Sword</b> and the Gargoyle Lens</li>

                    <li>The <b>8 Runes</b> which are used to unlock the <b>8 Shrines</b>(Each has an item)</li>
                    <li>The <b>Moon Orb</b> is used to quickly teleport around the world</li>
                    <li>The <b>Spell Book</b> allows you to cast spells</li>
                    <li>The <b>Spell - Unlock</b> allows you to unlock magically locked doors and chests</li>

                <h3>Getting Started Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Talk to <b>Lord British</b> to get the item <b>Key B</b> to exit the castle.</li>
                    <li>Give some <b>Cheese</b> to <b>Sherry the Mouse</b>. She is normally found along the outer rooms of the castle.(She is needed to get an item)</li>
                    <li>Open the <b>3 Chests</b> to get three randomized items along with anything else the chests have.</li>
                    <li>If Hints are Enabled get the <b>Book</b> from the chest in the small room and check Lord British's Locked room.</li>
                    <li>Take anything you want from the castle as everything is free and nothing is considered stolen.</li>
                    <li>Use the Key to exit the castle through the front gate.</li>
                    <li>Talk to Ariana and get the chests in Britain. This may lead you to the Shrine of Compassion to get an item there.</li>
                    <li>From here visit any cities you can reach. If playing without the Moon Orb, Paws and Skara Brae are good early places to visit.</li>

                    <li><b>NEVER</b> leave your <b>Skiff</b> or <b>Balloon</b> behind!!! They will be deleted and you will need to buy or craft a new one!</li>

                <h3>The Moon Orb</h3>
                The Moon Orb (otherwise known as the Orb of the Moons) lets you quickly teleport to 22 locations.
                To use it, simply throw it on the ground near you.
                You can throw it up to two tiles away, and where you throw it determines where you will teleport.
                Experiment with it and you will quickly learn how it works.
                </br></br>
                You can use it to teleport to:
                <ul>
                    <li>The 8 Virtue Cities(2 tiles out along the cardinal and ordinal directions with you at the center)</li>
                    <li>The 8 Shrines(one tile clockwise from each city)</li>
                    <li>3 of the Gargoyle Shrines (Down, Up Left, and Up Right)</li>
                    <li>The Gargoyle City (Down Left)</li>
                    <li>The Shrine of the Avatar (Down Right)</li>
                    <li>Lord British (Up)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Spells and Reagents</h3>
                To cast spells you must have a <b>Spellbook</b> equipped and know the spell.
                The two require spells are <b>Unlock</b> which can normally be purchased in Skara Brae and <b>Dispel Field</b> which can normally be purchased in Moonglow.
                You will likely often cast <b>Light</b> in caves and at night, and <b>Dispel Magic</b> to cure poisons. <b>Help</b> is a free spell that will teleport you to Lord British.
                </br></br>
                Spells cost reagents to use. The following reagents are needed for the most used spells:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Dispel Field</b> requires Blood Moss and Sulphurous Ash</li>
                    <li><b>Dispel Magic</b> requires Garlic and Ginseng</li>
                    <li><b>Heal</b> requires Ginseng and Spidersilk</li>
                    <li><b>Light</b> requires Sulphurous Ash</li>
                    <li><b>Unlock</b> requires Black Pearl and Sulphurous Ash</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Karma</h3>
                You will need to manage your Karma in the game, represented in your inventory screen as KR.
                Karma is lost for doing bad actions, such as <b>stealing and attacking non-violent characters</b>.
                Karma is gained when doing Quests and mainly from <b>Meditiating at Shrines</b>. Meditating is very important as it also can gain you levels and stats.
                To beat the game you will need at least 80 karma. To complete the Gargoyle Lens, you will need at least 75 karma.
                </br></br>
                No <b>Main Items</b> are treated as being stolen. All items in <b>Shrines</b> and <b>Underground</b> are also never treated as being stolen.
