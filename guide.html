                <h3>Quickstart Guide</h3>
                New to Ultima 6 for the SNES, need a refresher, or want tips that may help you along your randomized journey?
                Then this guide is for you! This is a quickstart guide meant to give you the bare minimum knowledge needed to help you along your way.
                The <b>View Information</b> panel on the randomizer page also contains extra information about the item locations.
                There are two web trackers, the <b>Location Tracker</b> and the <b>Character Tracker</b>, available on the bottom of the randomizer page which can make keeping track of where you have checked much easier.
                For more in depth information, check out any available strategy guides and of course maps you can find online!

                <h3>Goal</h3>
                The ultimate goal of Ultima 6 Randomizer is to beat the game.
                To do this at a minimum you will need to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Collect the <b>8 Moonstones</b></li>
                    <li>Collect the <b>Vortex Cube</b> and insert the 8 Moonstones into it</li>
                    <li>Collect the <b>Gargoyle Lens</b></li>
                    <li>Collect the <b>Human Lens</b></li>
                    <li>Craft a <b>Balloon</b> using the <b>Balloon Plans</b></li>
                    <li>Visit the <b>3 Gargoyle Shrines (Diligence, Control, and Passion)</b></li>
                    <li>Have at least <b>80 Karma</b></li>
                    <li>Have a <b>Spellbook</b> with the spell <b>Dispel Field</b> and visit the <b>Shrine of Singularity</b> via a <b>Balloon</b></li>
                    <li>Visit the <b>Shrine of the Avatar</b> to finish the game</li>
                </ul>
                Depending on how the items are randomized you are very likely to need to do quite a bit more.

                Other important items that you may need are:
                <ul>
                    <li>The <b>8 Runes</b> which are used to unlock the <b>8 Shrines</b>(Each has an item).</li>
                    <li>The <b>Moon Orb</b> is used to quickly teleport around the world.</li>
                    <li>The <b>Spellbook</b> allows you to cast spells.</li>
                    <li>The <b>Spell - Unlock</b> allows you to unlock magically locked doors and chests.</li>
                    <li>The <b>Spell - Dispel Field</b> allows you to remove magical fields that block your path.</li>
                    <li><b>Sherry the Mouse</b> who will give you access to an item in the Jhelom Tavern.</li>
                    <li>A <b>Shovel</b> which will allow you to dig an entrance into Pirate Cave.</li>
                    <li><b>Powder Kegs</b> which can be used to destroy non-magically locked doors.</li>
                    <li>Learn the Gargoyle Language from the <b>Gargish Text</b> to speak with Gargoyles.</li>
                    <li>The <b>Book of Oz</b> which can be given to Lord British for an item.</li>
                    <li>The <b>Book of Boardgames</b> which can be given to Dr Cat in Paws for an item.</li>
                    <li>The <b>Broken Lens</b> which can be given to the Gargoyle Lenscrafter for an item.</li>
                    <li>A <b>Glass Sword</b> which can be given to Ephemerides for an item if you have the <b>Gargoyle Lens</b>.</li>
                </ul>

                If Treasure Map Quest Locations are included other important items that you may need could include:
                <ul>
                    <li>The <b>Guild Belt</b> is used to get an item from Phoenix.</li>
                    <li>The <b>8 Map Pieces</b> are used to get an item from Homer. Map Piece #9 has no use.</li>
                    <li>A <b>Dragon Egg</b> which is given to Sandy in Trinsic.</li>
                </ul>

                If you selected the <b>Open Avatar Shrine</b> option then the Gargoyle Shrines (Diligence, Control, and Passion) as well as the Shrine of Singularity are no longer required.
                This can result in the possibility of not needing to craft a Balloon and/or not needing to have a Spellbook.

                <h3>Getting Started Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Talk to <b>Lord British</b> to get the item <b>Key B</b> to exit the castle.</li>
                    <li>Give some <b>Cheese</b> or <b>Odd Cheese</b> to <b>Sherry the Mouse</b>. She is normally found along the outer rooms of the castle.(She is needed to get an item)</li>
                    <li>Open the <b>3 Chests</b> to get three randomized items along with anything else the chests have.</li>
                    <li>If Hints are Enabled get the <b>Book</b> from the chest in the small room and check Lord British's Locked room.</li>
                    <li>Take anything you want from the castle as everything is free and nothing is considered stolen.</li>
                    <li>Use the Key to exit the castle through the front gate.</li>
                    <li>Talk to Ariana (child in Music Hall south-west of Castle gate) to get her item and get the chests in Britain.</li>
                    <li>From here visit any cities you can reach. If playing without the Moon Orb, Paws and Skara Brae are good early places to visit.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Other Useful Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are many hidden passages in the game. Look for the wall pattern to be different. There is one in Lord British's closet!</li>
                    <li>Selling items to Gwenneth in Britain is generally a good way to make money.</li>
                    <li><b>Invisibility Rings</b> are incredibly useful but have a chance of breaking every step you take while wearing one.</li>
                    <li>Using <b>Powder Kegs</b> to destroy doors is a sometimes necessary way to enter locked doors, so always carry a few.</li>
                    <li>Buying a <b>Skiff</b> is useful to reach islands.</li>
                    <li><b>NEVER</b> leave your <b>Skiff</b> or <b>Balloon</b> behind!!! They will be deleted and you will need to buy or craft a new one!</li>
                    <li><b>Karma</b> (KR on the inventory screen) changes the prices in shops and stealing too much will cause everything to become expensive!</li>
                </ul>

                 <h3>The 8 Virtues</h3>
                Ultima is a game about virtues. You play as the Avatar, the paragon of virtue. There are 8 virtues in the game.

                <h3>The Moon Orb</h3>
                The Moon Orb (otherwise known as the Orb of the Moons) lets you quickly teleport to 22 locations.
                To use it, simply throw it on the ground near you.
                You can throw it up to two tiles away, and where you throw it determines where you will teleport.
                Experiment with it and you will quickly learn how it works.
                </br></br>
                You can use it to teleport to:
                <ul>
                    <li>The 8 Virtue Cities(2 tiles out along the cardinal and ordinal directions with you at the center)</li>
                    <li>The 8 Shrines(one tile clockwise from each city)</li>
                    <li>3 of the Gargoyle Shrines (Down, Up Left, and Up Right)</li>
                    <li>The Gargoyle City (Down Left)</li>
                    <li>The Shrine of the Avatar (Down Right)</li>
                    <li>Lord British (Up)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Spells and Reagents</h3>
                To cast spells you must have a <b>Spellbook</b> equipped and know the spell.
                The two require spells are <b>Unlock</b> which can normally be purchased in Skara Brae and <b>Dispel Field</b> which can normally be purchased in Moonglow.
                You will likely often cast <b>Light</b> in caves and at night, and <b>Dispel Magic</b> to cure poisons. <b>Help</b> is a free spell that will teleport you to Lord British.
                </br></br>
                Spells cost reagents to use which can be found or bought from magic shops. There is a magic shop in Skara Brae, Moonglow, Cove, and one north of Britain in the Deep Forest.
                </br></br>
                The following reagents are needed for the most commonly used spells:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Dispel Field</b> requires Black Pearl and Sulphurous Ash. This spell removes barriers such as electric fields, fire fields, poison fields, and sleep fields.</li>
                    <li><b>Dispel Magic</b> requires Garlic and Ginseng. This spell will remove status effects from party members, such as poison.</li>
                    <li><b>Heal</b> requires Ginseng and Spidersilk. This spell heals a small amount of damage.</li>
                    <li><b>Light</b> requires Sulphurous Ash. This spell creates a large ring of light. Torches have a similiar effect and Great Light is more effective.</li>
                    <li><b>Unlock</b> requires Blood Moss and Sulphurous Ash. This spell unlocks magically locked doors and chests.</li>
                </ul>
                The reagents you are likely going to want to keep a large stock of are:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Black Pearl</b> - Used for Dispel Field</li>
                    <li><b>Blood Moss</b> - Used for Unlock</li>
                    <li><b>Sulphurous Ash</b> - Used for Dispel Field and Unlock</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Karma</h3>
                You will need to manage your Karma in the game, represented in your inventory screen as KR.
                Karma affects things such as what quests you can do, how NPCs respond to you, the prices of items in shops, and how much XP you keep on death.
                </br></br>
                Karma is lost for doing bad actions, such as <b>lying to children, stealing, and attacking non-violent characters</b>.
                </br></br>
                Karma is gained when doing Quests and mainly from <b>Meditiating at Shrines</b>. Meditating is very important as it also can gain you levels and stats.
                To beat the game you will need at least 80 karma. To complete the Gargoyle Lens, you will need at least 75 karma.
                </br></br>
                No <b>Main Items</b> are treated as being stolen. All items in <b>Shrines</b> and <b>Underground</b> are also never treated as being stolen.
                </br></br>
                Some tips on gaining Karma:
                <ul>
                    <li>Meditiating at each of the <b>8 Shrines</b> once you have used the correct <b>Rune</b> on them gives 10 karma each one time.</li>
                    <li>Watching the nomad girl <b>Karina </b> dance gives 10 karma one time. She can be found outside the inn in Britain at the start of the game.</li>
                    <li>Giving food to <b>Ybarra</b> at the bottom of the dungeon Shame gives 1 karma each time food is given.</li>
                    <li>Returning borrowed keys to <b>Pridgarm</b> the prison guard gives 7 karma one time.</li>
                    <li>Surrendering to <b>Draxinusom</b> will give 10 karma.</li>
                    <li>Beginning the final quest at the <b>Shrine of Singularity</b> will give 10 karma. This is not extremely useful as this is typically the final karma checkpoint.</li>
                </ul>

                <hr />
