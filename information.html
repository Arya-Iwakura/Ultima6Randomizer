                <h3>Information</h3>
                The Ultima 6 SNES Randomizer allows you to randomize a number of different elements to Ultima 6, giving you a endless amount of unique replays of the game.
                </br></br>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <ul>
                    <!--<li>The Character Randomizer allows you to play as other characters as well as randomize how characters in the world appear.</li>-->
                    <li>The Item Shuffler allows you to randomly shuffle items around in the world for when you want to enjoy an item hunt and more exploration.</li>
                    <li>The Spawn Randomizer allows you to shuffle AI spawns and their properties allowing for new combinations of surprises on AI placement.</li>
                    <li>The AI Randomizer allows you to shuffle and randomize enemies properties creating new combat experiences and challenges.</li>
                    <li>The Character Adjustments portion allows you to both shuffle and randomize player and party member properties.</li>
                    <li>The Item Adjustments portion allows you to adjust aspects of the items in the game to your liking.</li>
                    <li>The Gameplay Adjustments portion allows you to adjust aspects of the game to your liking.</li>
                    <!--<li>The World Randomizer allows you to randomize the layout of the world creating new worlds to explore.</li>-->
                </ul>
                
                <hr />

                <h3>Presets</h3>
                The <b>Overworld Locations</b> presets are the most straight forward and common way to play. These presets include the locations found on the overworld.</br>
                The <b>All Locations</b> presets are the longest and most encompassing of the presets requiring you to explore the entire game. These presets include locations from the entire game.</br>
                The <b>Underworld Locations</b> presets focus mostly on the underground portions of the game, such as caves and dungeons.</br>
                The <b>Daily Challenge</b> preset allows for you to play a unique random seed generated for each day. If you input a custom seed in the format YYYYMMDD you can get seeds for previous dates. Attempting to input dates in the future will simply use the current day.</br>
                The <b>Random Challenge</b> preset randomly selects settings when selected or when you update the custom seed field.</br></br>

                <hr />

                <h3>Item Shuffle Details</h3>
                The Item Shuffler will randomly shuffle all of the selected items between one another.
                If <b>"Main Items"</b> and <b>"Overworld Chests"</b> are selected, then Runes and Moonstones could be placed in any overworld chest or other main item locations!</br></br>
                The Item Shuffler will attempt to prevent any placement of items which would result in them being unreachable. If there are multiple items in a chest, the shuffler will choose to randomize only one item per chest.</br></br>
                You may choose to add the Moon Orb and/or Spellbook to the item shuffle pool, which will result in you starting with a random item from the item pool in their spot in your inventory. Choosing to include the Spellbook will also replace spellbooks in shops of Horance, Rudyom, and Xiao with other items.</br></br>
                If you choose to randomize the spells, Dispel Field and Unlock will be removed from shops and random placed along with the other selected items. This will force the Xiao and Horance chests to be in the item pool as well. If this is chosen, be careful to never drop the spell item on the ground, as this will softlock the game.</br></br>
                When you choose to add the unique Sherry item, Sherry will now require you to find the item Odd Cheese before she will join your party. This will force the Skara Brae Wine Cellar chest to be in the item pool as well.</br></br>

                <h3>Spawn Randomization Details</h3>
                The Spawn Randomizer allows you to randomize enemy and creature spawns.</br></br>
                If <b>"Randomly Mix"</b> is <b>NOT</b> selected, then creatures will only randomize with their own type, so monsters can only appear where other monsters could appear.</br></br>
                If <b>"Randomly Mix"</b> <b>IS</b> selected then all selected creature types are mixed together. Monsters can now appear where anything else selected could appear!</br></br>

                <h4>Spawn Number</h4>
                Each creature spawn point in the game has settings on how many creatures appear from their at once. If default is selected, the original spawn point numbers are used.</br></br>
                You can choose to <b>"Shuffle"</b> the Spawn Numbers which will take all spawn numbers from every spawner in the game and then shuffle them and reassign them.</br></br>
                It is also possible to completely randomize the spawn numbers by selecting <b>"Random Spawn Numbers"</b>.</br></br>

                <h4>Aggression</h4>
                Aggression is assigned to creatures based on the spawn point they spawn at. This is the default setting.</br></br>
                When randomly mixing creatures, you may find character types no longer have the aggression you would expect. The <b>"Intuitive Aggression"</b> option assigns aggression based on creature type and not from the spawn point.</br></br>
                You can choose to <b>"Shuffle Aggression"</b>, which will shuffle the aggression of all spawns. Sheep or guards in town could now attack you!</br></br>
                For those who want to not worry about being attacked randomly, you can select <b>"Passive"</b> and all creatures will now ignore you unless you attack first.
                
                <hr />

                <h3>AI Options Details</h3>
                <b>"Shuffle AI Stats"</b> will take the entire set of stats from each AI, and shuffle them between themselves.</br></br>
                <b>"Shuffle Spellcasters"</b> will shuffle which AI can cast spells, maintaining the same ratio of spellcasters to non-spellcasters as the base game.</br></br>
                <b>"Shuffle Equipment Users"</b> will shuffle which AI use armor and weapons, maintaining the same ratio of equipment users to non-equipment users as the base game.</br></br>
                <b>"Shuffle Drop Possessors"</b> will shuffle which AI have non-armor and non-weapon drops. This maintains the same ratio of drop possessors to non-drop possessors as the base game.</br></br>
                <b>"Randomize AI Drops"</b> will randomize the non-armor and non-weapon drops for each AI that is a drop possessor.</br></br>
                <b>"Maintain Believable Spellcasters, Equipment, and Drops"</b> will enforce restrictions from the base game based on AI type on if the AI would be believable casting spells, using armor and weapons, or having certain categories of drops.</br></br>
                If you select <b>"Add Missing Enemies from PC Version"</b> then the Silver Serpent and Zu Flower will be added back to the game. These were unfinished in the SNES port. Due to limitiations the recreated versions are not identical to the PC version.</br></br>
                <b>"Add Missing Spells to AI"</b> fixes a bug that prevents the AI from using all assigned spells. With this, AI can now cast all the spells they could on the PC version as well.</br></br>
                You can use <b>"AI Stat Difficulty"</b> to either decrease or increase the strength, dexterity, and intelligence stats of AI to make for an easier or harder experience.</br></br>
                You can use <b>"AI Health Difficulty"</b> to either decrease or increase the health and armor values of AI to make for an easier or harder experience.</br></br>
                You can use <b>"AI Damage Difficulty"</b> to either decrease or increase the damage values of AI to make for an easier or harder experience.</br></br>
                You can use <b>"AI Spell Difficulty"</b> to either add remove or add spells from the AI spell lists to make for an easier or harder experience.</br></br>
                Options under <b>"AI Spells"</b> allow you to randomize or shuffle the spell lists for any AI that can cast spells.</br></br>
                Options under <b>"AI Equipment"</b> allow you to randomize or shuffle armor and weapons for any AI that can use armor and weapons.

The randomizer will pick a tier of gear, then randomly a set of armor and seperately a set of weapons, and lastly choose random options from within that set. Each set has a number of options per piece, ensuring there are millions of combinations.</br></br>
                With <b>"Chaotic"</b> randomization your gear and items are completely random and may be non-sensical.</br></br>

                <h4>Starting Gold</h4>

                <h4>Other Searchable Items</h4>
                Other searchable items are items found in chests, crates, barrels, drawers, backpacks, bags, tombs, etc that are not main items or the items included in the main item shuffle.</br></br>
                <b>Shuffle</b> takes all the other searchable items in the game and shuffles them around between each other.</br></br>
                <b>Random</b> will randomize each searchable item spot to one from a list that is based on the location of that searchable item.</br></br>

                <h4>Item Difficulty Details</h4>
                You can choose to make items and effects less difficult or more difficult.</br></br>
                When <b>"Easy Item Mode"</b> is selected, regeneration and invisiblity items and spells break and wear off less frequently.</br></br>
                When <b>"Hard Item Mode"</b> is selected, regeneration and invisiblity items and spells break and wear off much more frequently.

                <hr />

                <h3>Gameplay Adjustments Details</h3>
                <b>"Enable Expanded Camping"</b> will allow you to sleep in town, which can greatly reduce frustration around trying to find an ideal camping spot.</br></br>
                <b>"Enable Expanded Button Mapping"</b> puts actions onto additional controller buttons beyond only the original A(open menu) and D-Pad(move) buttons.
                <ul>
                    <li>D-Pad - Move</li>
                    <li>A - Open Menu</li>
                    <li>B - Cancel Action / Close Menu</li>
                    <li>Y - Look</li>
                    <li>X - Talk</li>
                    <li>L - Cast</li>
                    <li>R - Attack</li>
                    <li>Start - Inventory</li>
                </ul></br>
                <b>"Randomize Moon Cycles"</b> will start the moon phases at a different phase offset from where they normally start at the beginning of a game.</br></br>
                <b>"Open Shrine of the Avatar"</b> removes the need to do the Gargoyle Shrines and allows entering the Shrine of the Avatar at any time.</br></br>

                <h4>Time Adjustment Details</h4>
                In Ultima 6, 1 minute of in game time passes for every step you take. Full daylight hours are between 06:00 and 19:00 and are when most NPCs are awake.</br></br>
                You can choose to lengthen the daylight hours by <b>2x or 3x</b> which means that 1 minute of in game time during daylight hours will pass only after 2 steps or 3 steps taken. Night hour time passing still occurs at 1 minute per step taken.</br></br>
                If you choose to <b>"Use PC Version Day and Night Lengths"</b> then both the day and night will be 2x as long.</br></br>

                <h4>Karma Adjustment Details</h4>
                You can choose to make Karma less difficult or more difficult.</br></br>
                When <b>"Easy Karma Mode"</b> is selected, all penalities are reduced to 1 karma loss, you start at 100 karma instead of 75, and all karma rewards are doubled.</br></br>
                When <b>"Hard Karma Mode"</b> is selected, all penalities are doubled and you start at 60 instead of 75 karma.</br></br>

                <h4>Shrine of Spirituality Warp</h4>
                There are options to add an island north of Empath Abbey that has a warp to the Shrine of Spirituality.</br></br>
                Adding the island is recommended when playing with removed Moon Orb, as the game intends you to use the Moon Orb to reach the shrine.</br></br>
                When <b>Add Island Warp</b> is selected, an island with a cave that requires a boat to reach will appear north of Empath Abbey.</br></br>
                When <b>Add Island Warp (Requires Flying)</b> is selected, an island with a cave that requires a balloon to reach will appear north of Empath Abbey.</br></br>
                When <b>Add Island Warp (Random Requirements)</b> is selected, an island with a cave that will appear north of Empath Abbey with random chance on if it needs a balloon or not.</br></br>

                <h4>Placed Rafts</h4>
                In the base game, there are a few pre-placed rafts around the world. These options allow you to add or remove those rafts.</br></br>
                Adding safety rafts is recommended when playing with the Spellbook or Moon Orb randomized or removed as it becomes easier to get stuck.</br></br>
                If <b>Add Safety Rafts and Gates</b> is selected, rafts and gates are added to potential stuck spots for if you have no Moon Orb or Spellbook.</br></br>
                If <b>Trap All Placed Rafts</b> is selected all the current rafts in the game will be moved to areas where they can not reach the ocean.
