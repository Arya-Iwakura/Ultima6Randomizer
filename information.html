<span class="badge">Item Shuffle Details</span></br>
    The Item Shuffler will randomly shuffle all of the selected items between one another.
    If <b>"Main Items"</b> and <b>"Overworld Chests"</b> are selected, then Runes and Moonstones could be placed in any overworld chest or other main item locations!</br></br>
    The Item Shuffler will attempt to prevent any placement of items which would result in them being unreachable. 
    If there are multiple items in a chest, the shuffler will choose to randomize only one item per chest. </br></br>
    You may choose to add the Moon Orb and/or Spellbook to the item shuffle pool, which will result in you starting with a random item from the item pool in their spot in your inventory.</br></br>

<span class="badge">Spawn Randomization Details</span></br>
The Spawn Randomizer allows you to randomize enemy and creature spawns.</br></br>
If <b>"Randomly Mix"</b> is <b>NOT</b> selected, then creatures will only randomize with their own type, so monsters can only appear where other monsters could appear.</br></br>
If <b>"Randomly Mix"</b> <b>IS</b> selected then all selected creature types are mixed together. Monsters can now appear where anything else selected could appear!</br></br>

<span class="badge">Aggression Details</span></br>

You can choose to <b>"Shuffle Aggression"</b>, which will shuffle the aggression of all spawns. Sheep or guards in town could now attack you!</br></br>

<b>"Remove Moon Orb"</b> will remove the Moon Orb completely from the game. If there Moon Orb was selected for randomization, a random item will be selected to replace it.</br></br>
<b>"Enable Expanded Camping"</b> will allow you to sleep in town, which can greatly reduce frustration around trying to find an ideal camping spot.</br></br>

    <li>A - Open Menu</li>
    <li>B - Cancel Action / Close Menu</li>

<span class="badge">Starting Inventory Details</span></br>
You can choose to start with the default inventory, none, or between different styles of randomization for the inventory.</br></br>
The <b>"Tier and Set Based"</b> randomization randomizes your gear and items but ensure that it feels more purposeful and crafted. The randomizer will pick a tier of gear, then randomly a set of armor and seperately a set of weapons, and lastly choose random options from within that set. Each set has a number of options per piece, ensuring there are millions of combinations.</br></br>
With <b>"Chaotic"</b> randomization your gear and items are completely random and may be non-sensical.</br></br>

<span class="badge">Starting Gold Details</span></br>
You start the game with 200g by default, but you can choose to start with less, more, or a random amount.</br></br>

<span class="badge">Time Adjustment Details</span></br>
In Ultima 6, 1 minute of in game time passes for every step you take. Full daylight hours are between 06:00 and 19:00 and are when most NPCs are awake.</br></br>
You can choose to lengthen the daylight hours by <b>2x or 3x</b> which means that 1 minute of in game time during daylight hours will pass only after 2 steps or 3 steps taken. Night hour time passing still occurs at 1 minute per step taken.</br></br>
If you choose to <b>"Use PC Version Day and Night Lengths"</b> then both the day and night will be 2x as long.</br></br>

<span class="badge">Karma Adjustment Details</span></br>
You can choose to make Karma less difficult or more difficult.</br></br>
When <b>"Easy Karma Mode"</b> is selected, all penalities are reduced to 1 karma loss, you start at 100 karma instead of 75, and all karma rewards are doubled.</br></br>
When <b>"Hard Karma Mode"</b> is selected, all penalities are doubled and you start at 60 instead of 75 karma.</br></br>

<span class="badge">Shrine of Spirituality Warp</span></br>
There are options to add an island north of Empath Abbey that has a warp to the Shrine of Spirituality.</br></br>
Adding the island is recommended when playing with removed Moon Orb, as the game intends you to use the Moon Orb to reach the shrine.</br></br>
When <b>Add Island Warp</b> is selected, an island with a cave that requires a boat to reach will appear north of Empath Abbey.</br></br>
When <b>Add Island Warp (Requires Flying)</b> is selected, an island with a cave that requires a balloon to reach will appear north of Empath Abbey.</br></br>
When <b>Add Island Warp (Random Requirements)</b> is selected, an island with a cave that will appear north of Empath Abbey with random requirements on if it needs a balloon or not.</br></br>

<span class="badge">Placed Rafts</span></br>
In the base game, there are a few pre-placed rafts around the world. These options allow you to add or remove those rafts.</br></br>
Adding safety rafts is recommended when playing with the Moon Orb randomized or removed as it becomes easier to get stuck.</br></br>
If <b>Add Safety Rafts</b> is selected rafts are added to each of the Shrine islands to prevent getting stuck if taking an accidental Moongate.</br></br>
If <b>Trap All Placed Rafts</b> is selected all the current rafts in the game will be moved to areas where they can not reach the ocean.</br></br>

<span class="badge">Other Details</span></br>
<b>"Enable Spoiler Log"</b> grants you access to seeing where all the items were placed. This can be good to reference if you get completely stuck.</br></br>
<b>"Enable Hints"</b> will replace text in various scrolls and books to give vague hints about the locations of any Main Items.</br></br>
When <b>"Hide Seed In Game"</b> is selected, the seed value will no longer be visible in the game.</br></br>
<b>"Remove Seed & Flags from Filename"</b> will generate a random value for the filename.</br></br>
Combining <b>"Hide Seed In Game"</b> and <b>"Remove Seed & Flags from Filename"</b> allows you to create hidden seeds for the purposes of races, tournaments, or simply surprises for others.</br></br>
